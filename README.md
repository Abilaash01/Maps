# Maps

This simple website displays the user's current location, with the use of Google Maps API.

To run this site, follow the steps:

Fork the code to your local machine
Open cmd and cd into the source code directory
Run npm start or type this address: http://localhost:1234/
Now you can let the maps pin-point to your current location and you can zoom in or out.
Voila
